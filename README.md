Awesome! Just a few things we would love to see:
1. Clean code, very important.
2. Commits with GitMoji, click [here](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) to see all the emojis. Simply put one emoji in front of the commit message, example: `:sparkles: Added a new page!`

# What do we use
We use `Svelte 3` and `Sapper` to build our website, they are both amazing libraries and frameworks.
Next to that, we use Sveltestrap to easily use Bootstrap components in our website. For the docs, check [this](https://bestguy.github.io/sveltestrap/) page.
