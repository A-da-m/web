A handly list of things that need to be built

- [ ] The blog posts need to be grabbed out of a database (preferably MongoDB for the posts). The things are located in `/routes/blog`. Be sure to test before making a PR and also check the Svelte/Sapper Docs (and the information inside of comments in the files).
- [ ] An easy way for admins to add posts to the website, some sort of control panel/endpoint with API keys.
- [ ] Comments on blog posts, authentication with Discord.
- [ ] Like buttons on posts.
- [ ] A funky design for the website, made with bootstrap (svelstetrap of course, where possible.)
- [ ] More?
